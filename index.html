        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="intro-sentence">I'm a software developer and web designer, a believer in well-crafted code, open source, good design, and sustainable software.</p>
        <p>
            I started my professional journey as an electronics engineer. I wanted to build guitar amps and audio equipment but during my graduate studies, found out I enjoyed writing audio software more. I transitioned into software development and there found a love of designing user interfaces. Now, I'm building websites for my own projects and (eventually) people in my local community.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always been meticulous in whatever I do, whether it's learning how to make sauerkraut, developing photographic film, or designing a new software feature. I'm a big proponent of clean code and architecture and enjoy a good code review almost as much as writing the code itself. Just as important as the back end is making getting the user-facing design right. I love reading about graphic design, art, and photography and these influence my work in web design. Sustainability is another important value I hold, so I make sure to follow green software development practices on my own projects.
